# Big O Notation

- We use the Big O Notation to describe the performance of an algorithm.

## What is Big O?

__Big O is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behaviour of a 
function when the argument tends towards a particular value of infinity.__ - Wikipedia

* ☝️That is why __Big O__ scares people because the definition itself is quite 
scary. 

* The _Big O_ notation is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm.
    * What is the performance of the algorithm as the input scales up?
    * Is the algorithm still fast given a huge data set? 

* The _Big O_ is represented as `O(n)`.
